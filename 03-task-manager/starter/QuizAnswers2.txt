1.  
    "asyncWrapper" was created and applied to reduce amount of the code inside of the Tasks controller. 
    Each function there is async, so we can apply a middleware to make it cleaner.

2. 
    This is already implemented inside of the "getTask" function:

const getTask = asyncWrapper(async (req, res, next) => {  
  const { id: taskID } = req.params;  
  const task = await Task.findOne({ _id: taskID });  
  if (!task) {
    return next(createCustomError(`No ${req.params.id} task founded`, 404))
  }
  res.status(200).json({ task });  
});
